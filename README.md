Optimized FlashText with Directed Word Graphs
This repository contains an optimized version of the FlashText Python module, which is used for fast keyword searching and replacing in strings. The original implementation relied on nested dictionaries, which posed scalability and performance issues. This project introduces an enhancement by leveraging Directed Word Graphs (DWG) to optimize storage and retrieval of string data.

Features
Improved Performance: Enhanced speed and efficiency for large datasets.
Memory Optimization: Reduced memory usage compared to nested dictionary-based implementations.
Scalable Design: Supports handling large keyword datasets seamlessly.
